This is a piece of code to receive values from Load Cell and HX711 using aurdino.

Few keyPoints to be noted- 

1. All the tabs of code should be inside same folder.
2. This code is little broad bec it include LED,BUZZER etc. You can do changes according to your needs.
3. You are required to download an aurdino library called HX711 before running the code.
4. There is a pin tab where all the pins are intialized, you can change the pins of different sensors in this according to your needs. this will help you while wiring the circuits.
5. To calibrate the sensor you jst need to take the reading of load cell, while keeping 1 kg weight over it. and now copy that reading to cablibratedTerm variable in WeightInIt tab.
6. Now Code is ready.
